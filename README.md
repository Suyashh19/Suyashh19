### The Perspective

I am a second-year student currently exploring the intersection of theoretical machine learning and practical software engineering. My approach is rooted in the belief that true understanding comes from building. Rather than chasing every new tool, I prioritize a strong foundation in data structures, mathematical principles, and clean code to solve real-world problems.

### Tech Stack

* **Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript
* **Machine Learning:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
* **Application Layer:** React, Streamlit
* **Developer Tools:** Git, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook

### Selected Work

#### 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based engine designed to address discovery friction. I utilized **cosine similarity** for its mathematical efficiency and interpretability in high-dimensional vector spaces.

* **Decision:** Opted for content-based filtering over collaborative methods to eliminate the "cold start" problem inherent in small-scale interaction data.
* **Deployment:** Used **Streamlit** to bridge the gap between a Python model and a functional user interface with minimal latency.
* **[Live Application](https://movie-recommender-app-hk9zssrecgokfqokvtyv3b4hp.streamlit.app/)**

#### ☁️ Cloudinary SaaS Media Vault

A focused media management application handling secure uploads and previews.

* **Focus:** Bridging the gap between frontend state management and cloud-based asset storage.

### Engineering Notes

Through my work in Machine Learning, I’ve refined a few core principles:

* **Data > Algorithm:** Model performance is almost always a reflection of data representation and preprocessing quality rather than the complexity of the model itself.
* **The UX of ML:** Practical systems must balance predictive accuracy with system latency. A perfect model is useless if the inference time breaks the user experience.
* **Maintainability:** Clear pipelines and modular code are not optional; they are the baseline requirements for experimentation and long-term maintenance.

### Current Focus

I am currently deepening my understanding of model evaluation metrics and the design of end-to-end ML applications. My goal is to move beyond notebooks and into the architecture of systems that scale and persist.

### 01 . Perspective
I am a second-year undergraduate specializing in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**. My work is driven by a focus on strong fundamentals—data structures, mathematical principles, and clean engineering. I don’t just use tools; I build practical systems to bridge the gap between abstract theory and real-world deployment.

### 02 . The Toolkit
* **Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript
* **Machine Learning:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
* **Application Layer:** React, Streamlit
* **Environment:** Git, VS Code, Jupyter, Linux

### 03 . Selected Case Studies

#### **Movie Recommendation System**
*The Challenge:* Navigating vast content libraries without user interaction data.
* **Approach:** Implemented a content-based engine using **Cosine Similarity** to map item vectors in high-dimensional space.
* **Result:** A low-latency recommendation interface deployed via Streamlit, prioritizing interpretability over "black-box" complexity.
* [**Live App**](https://movie-recommender-app-hk9zssrecgokfqokvtyv3b4hp.streamlit.app/)

#### **Cloudinary SaaS Media Vault**
*The Challenge:* Creating a centralized, secure media lifecycle.
* **Approach:** Built a React-based vault focused on seamless upload pipelines and state-driven media previews.

### 04 . Machine Learning Journal
> *Notes on building and scaling intelligent systems.*

* **Data Representation:** I've found that performance gains are rarely about the algorithm; they are about how well the data is preprocessed and represented to the model.
* **The Latency Trade-off:** Practical ML is a balancing act between accuracy and user experience. A 99% accurate model that takes 5 seconds to respond is often inferior to a 94% model that responds in 100ms.
* **Pipelines:** Modular code and clear data pipelines are the only way to move from "it works on my machine" to "it works in production."

### 05 . Current Trajectory
I am currently deepening my understanding of **model evaluation frameworks** and architecting **end-to-end ML applications** that go beyond the notebook environment.

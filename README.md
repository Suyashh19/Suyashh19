### 👋 A short note
> I’m an undergraduate working in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, interested in building systems that connect theory with real-world use cases.  
>  
> I care deeply about **fundamentals**—how data is represented, how decisions are made, and how systems behave once deployed.

### 🧠 ML design decisions
> Constraints often lead to better systems.

- Content-based filtering chosen due to limited user–item interaction data  
- Cosine similarity used for efficiency, simplicity, and interpretability  
- Streamlit selected for rapid ML prototyping and deployment  

---

### 📘 ML learnings
> Building ML systems reshaped how I think about models.

- Data representation and preprocessing often matter more than algorithm choice  
- Real-world ML requires balancing **accuracy**, **latency**, and **UX**  
- Modular pipelines significantly improve experimentation and maintainability  

---

### 🎯 Current focus
- Understanding **model evaluation & failure modes**
- Designing **end-to-end ML applications**
- Improving **problem-solving and system thinking**
